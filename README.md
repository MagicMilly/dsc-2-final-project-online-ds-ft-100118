### Hypothesis 1
* H0 - There is no statistically significant difference in the quantity ordered of discounted vs. non-discounted products.
   * H0:  𝜇1  =  𝜇2 
* H1 - There is a statistically significant difference in the quantity ordered of discounted vs. non-discounted products.
   * HA:  𝜇1   ≠   𝜇2 

### Hypothesis 2
* H0 - The top employee does not sell more in dollars than the average employee.
   * H0:  𝜇   ≤   𝜇0 
* H2 - The top employee sells more in dollars than the average employee.
   * HA:  𝜇  >  𝜇0 

### Hypothesis 3
* H0 - The top product does not sell more in quantity than the other products.
   * H0:  𝜇   ≤   𝜇0 
* H3 - The top product sells more in quantity than the other products.
   * HA:  𝜇  >  𝜇0 

### Hypothesis 4
* H0 - There is no statistically significant difference in revenue generated from customers in countries where there are employees vs. countries where there are no employees.
   * H0: 𝜇1  =  𝜇2 
* H4 - There is a statistically significant difference in revenue generated from customers in countries where there are employees vs. countries where there are no employees.
   * HA: 𝜇1   ≠   𝜇2
